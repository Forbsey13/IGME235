    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover that’s as deep as its labyrinthine caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.</blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/hollow_knight/review/article-1895.html">For me, Hollow Knight's true quality lies in its ability to reward perseverance, to reward curiosity and exploration. That challenge was so difficult, the contrast between the stark cave and what I discovered so significant, that it made me feel like I must've been the first person ever to discover it. That's something I rarely experience in a game. Hollow Knight is one of the best 2D platformers I've ever played - it is a beautiful, quirky and dynamic game; challenging yet rewarding; mournful yet brimming with hope. When it comes to console, it's going to cause a real stir.</blockquote>

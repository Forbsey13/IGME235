    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h3>Checkpoint 1 Progress</h3>
    <p>I focused more on the basic web version of my website since I have run into a lot of troubles with CSS grid</p>
    <p>The goal of the website is to tell more about myself and have pictures/examples to demonstrate things that I've done</p>
    <p>My biggest challenge was sorting out the grid layout as CSS grid did not want to cooperate</p>

    <h3>Checkpoint 2 Progress</h3>
    <p>I made great strides in understanding css during this checkpoint. From the much smoother use of grid + flexbox the top half of my website it much smoother</p>
    <p>However I continued to run into problems with making the main image compatible with my responsive website design. Wasting hours upon hours changing around the code hopinh it might finally click</p>
    <p>My final super positive addition was the slideshow which does a solid job going through my projects in order of length made / difficulty</p>

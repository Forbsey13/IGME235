    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>The main idea of the website was to input or randomly recieve 2 pokemon and display their stats and type matchup. Unfortunately I had not realized until much later into the project that the PokeAPI types calling does not work and I was not able to create the main feature I was excited for. On top of this my computer does not always access the information from the API quickly with the current calls I have so it would have been even slower. Overall however if the API had worked correctly I had an appealing spot in between the combatting colors of the pokemon to show who would have the advantage.</p>

    <h2>Meeting the Requirements</h2>
    <h3>Functional</h3>
    <p>I used the PokeAPI since it seemed to have the most info on Pokemon. The feature saving the words in the textbox works properly as well as a save feature I added that lets you save and then load a sprite version of your saved pokemon that you can chose from. The main controls are the radnomizing button and the load button which spawns all of your favorited pokemon as clickable sprites to get back to their specific page. The extra feature is having an extra search field wthat works with the search button as well.</p>
    <h3>Design & Interaction</h3>
    <p>As a fan of dark mode I made the website a simple all black with white text while making the buttons and searchboxes symmetrical and not overwhelming. The main draw of the website is the clash of color between the pokemon which was intended to further any type matchup rivalry that they might have had. </p>
    <h3>HTML/CSS & Media</h3>
    <p>The HTML and Javascript are validated. The CSS is in a linked file</p>
    <h3>Code Conventions</h3>
    <p>All code is in a seperate javascript file that is function based to limit duplicate code. I also followed the coding standards and left comments mainly outside of functions since most lines inside the functions follow a cohesive pattern.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a <strong>vehicle</strong> based, <strong>futuristic</strong> variant of <strong>soccer</strong>. Just like the original game it is played in a large arena with two teams of cars. As with soccer the goal is to score by launching a giant ball into the goal of the opposing team. The arena has curved edges with large walls, so the ball cannot leave the pitch and bounces back, and it is possible to <strong>drive up the sides.</strong></p>

    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/06/rocket-league-review">Rocket League’s colorfully absurd cars-playing-sports concept works so well because the energy of its arcadey gameplay meshes with its deep team-based strategy and variety of modes. It’s exceedingly rare to find a multiplayer game that’s welcoming and approachable for new players and so intricate that the best players can earn a living by mastering its depths. Rocket League is a golden example of turning a good idea into something truly amazing.</blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://gamegravy.com/review/rocket-league/">This is the boldest statement I have ever made regarding a game in one of my reviews:  Rocket League is the best indie title I’ve ever played.  It does for the online sports indie genre what Shovel Knight did for the side scrolling genre.  This game is not only better then almost if not any indie game released this year, it’s also better then most of the full retail titles.  If you didn’t get Rocket League with your plus subscription, go get it now, it is easily worth the $20.</blockquote>
